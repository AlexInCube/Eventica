### What platforms does Eventica support? {docsify-ignore}

Everything, because Eventica is pure GML and doesn’t do anything hacky or weird. 
You might run into edge cases on platforms that I haven’t tested.
Please [report any bugs](https://github.com/AlexInCube/Eventica/issues) if and when you find them.

### How is Eventica licensed? Can I use it for commercial projects? {docsify-ignore}

Eventica is released under the MIT license. 
This means you can use it for whatever purpose you want, including commercial projects. 
It’d mean a lot to me if you’d drop my name in your credits (AlexInCube) and/or say thanks, but you’re under no obligation to do so.

### I think you’re missing a useful feature, and I’d like you to implement it! {docsify-ignore}
Great! Please make a [feature request](https://github.com/AlexInCube/Eventica/issues). 
Feature requests make Eventica a more fun tool to use and gives me something to think about when I’m bored on public transport.

I found a bug, and it both scares and mildly annoys me. What is the best way to get the problem solved?
Please make a bug report. AlexInCube checks GitHub every day and bug fixes usually go out a couple of days after that.

### Can I send you donations? Are you going to start a Patreon? {docsify-ignore}

You can support me on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/alexincube). I'd be happy to have your support.
